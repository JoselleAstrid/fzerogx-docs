# Addresses

## Notes

- \[Brackets\] in an address calculation indicate a pointer dereference.
- "(Dupe)" means a value seems to be an exact duplicate of a previously covered value.
- "(A)" "(B)" etc. denote multiple versions of basically the same value. Either the nature of the differences is unknown, or it's not known whether there are differences.
- "(Derived)" means a value seems to have a simple derivation from a previously covered value, and it's unknown whether this value serves some other purpose.
- "-" for Item and Type means the value is always 0 from observations so far, or it's not always 0 but it's totally unknown what kind of value it could be.

## Base addresses and pointers

- Reference pointer = Start address + \[Start address + 0x30C8\] - 0x80000000

## Memory blocks

- [Base machine stat blocks](base_machine_stat_blocks.md)
- [Racer block 1](racer_block_1.md)
- [Racer block 2](racer_block_2.md) (TODO)
