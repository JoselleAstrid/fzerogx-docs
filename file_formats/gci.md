# GCI file format: Gamecube memory card files

The first 0x40 bytes of a GCI file follow the same format for every game.

In F-Zero GX, each GCI file follows the same format for the first 0x20A0 bytes. From 0x20A0 onward, the format differs depending on what kind of GX file it is:

- [Emblem](gci_emblem.md)
- Garage
- Ghost
- [Replay](gci_replay.md)
- [Save file](gci_savefile.md)

Some of these formats have editor tools available. When an editor tool is not available, refer to: [Manually editing a GCI file](gci_manual_edit.md)
