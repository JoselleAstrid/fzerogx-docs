- Lift off of the track.
- Ensure that your checkpoint is located before the first turn, not after it.
- Fly out wide to the right.
- Cross the finish line backwards when you're far enough from the track.
- Get a little closer to the track, and cross the line forwards (above the finish line) to complete the lap.
- Land on the track (in front of the finish line). Lift off again and repeat the flying route.

This map shows example successes and failures for the backward crossing. Each line segment represents position change in 1 frame.

- Left of the intersection of checkpoints 108 and 0: Backward crossing always succeeds
- Slightly right of this intersection: Backward and forward crossings may succeed or fail
- Far right of this intersection: Forward crossing always succeeds

There is a particular building that is near the backward crossing location. Use this building as a visual guide; watch a video and you'll see.

If you're positioned correctly, both crossings can be done in a single left-turning stride. To ensure your forward crossing is far right enough, you may want to do a wider stride than normal: hold the control stick only halfway, and release the accelerator to maintain your height.

It's not a good idea to do the backward crossing too far left, for two reasons:

- You won't be able to do both the backward crossing and forward crossing in a single left-turning stride.
- When you're far enough left, all the buildings will disappear from view - you'll only be able to see your machine and a white background. It's easy to get lost like this.
